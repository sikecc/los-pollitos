# Los Pollitos Final Project
![Node.js CI](https://github.com/sikecc/los-pollitos/workflows/Node.js%20CI/badge.svg?branch=master)
## Description

TODO app allows you to better manage your time by allowing you to lay out what you need to accomplish and then coordinate your time from there. A TODO App lets a user create, read, update, and/or delete to-do tasks. Essentially, the task will have a title describing the goal of the task. Once the task is done, it can be marked as completed and/or deleted. For users to use our application, they need to create an account. Once logged in, users will be able to create tasks in our web application UI or view tasks created from different services (such as Google Task or Outlook Task) by using the appropriate API. In our application they will be able to add a timeframe to complete the tasks.

For each specialization, you must list specific checkpoints that are relevant to that particular specialization.

## Deliverables for final project

Outline in English what the deliverables will be for the final checkpoint. This will should be
similar to the **Description** above, but written out as an explicit checklist rather than a human
readable description. Reminder that this is not *due* until checkpoint 4, but failing to plan is
planning to fail.

For each specialization, you must list specific checkpoints that are relevant to that particular specialization.

## Specialization deliverables

For each student/team adding a specialization, name that specialization and describe what
functionality you will be adding.
